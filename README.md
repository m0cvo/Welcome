# Welcome
A Razor Page Demo

This demonstrates the use of a razor page for web app design.  When a razor page is created, a page model is also created so this app demonstrates how both the page and
the model work in sync to provide an interactive web page.

The demo page can be accessed by running the app using <Ctrl>+<F5> and when it opens in your localhost browser window either clicking on the demo link or appending the 
URL in the window with /Welcome (localhost:7299/Welcome).
